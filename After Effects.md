## Keyframe Values

The graph represents the value of a property. Each node (point) is the keyframe value (the value at a point in time).

**Example:**
If it's rotation it'll be a positive or negative angle.
If it's position it'll be the pixel position (x, y).

###### Dimensions (X, Y): 
For value pairs like (x, y), it'll show both of them at the same time.

It'll show x as red and y as green and their keyframes will both move at the same time.

You can ***separate dimensions*** to move them independently by right clicking the property and clicking separate dimensions like below:
